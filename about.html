      <h4>The Founders</h4>
      <article class="is-collapsed">
        <p>The Robert W. Deutsch Foundation exists through the generosity of Bob Deutsch and Florence Kadish Deutsch, who believed in giving back to the community, supporting education and helping others throughout their lives. Throughout his career, Robert W. Deutsch was equally at home on the frontiers of science and technology and in the offices, factories and facilities of Fortune 100 companies.</p>
        <h5>Career</h5>
        <p>As a graduate student in nuclear physics at  UC Berkeley in the early 1950s and as an expert in the nuclear industry in the 1950s and 60s, Dr. Deutsch realized that the future of American industry would be shaped by increasingly complex technologies and systems.  Helping major corporations use and manage rapidly changing technologies would become a central focus for his career.</p>
        <p>In 1968, Dr. Deutsch launched his career as an entrepreneur with the founding of General Physics Corporation.  Soon General Physics became the leading provider of education and training programs for operating personnel in the nation’s nuclear power plants.  His innovative training methods quickly proved to the industry that they could meet the stringent federal standards for operating safety by investing in the training of their plant personnel.  Success in the United States led to contracts with nuclear power plant operators in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</p>
        <p>At a time when most of his peers were retiring, Dr. Deutsch left General Physics to start RWD Technologies in 1988.  The new company allowed Dr. Deutsch to expand his scope of operations, focusing on the IT revolution that was transforming the way companies manufactured products, managed their business operations and communicated with their suppliers and customers.  Over the next twenty years, “Dr. D,” as he was known to his colleagues and co-workers throughout the company, led RWD Technologies to become a world leader in performance improvement training and productivity products and services.</p>
        <p>“We bring people and technologies together” was a well-known credo inside RWD Technologies.  The company grew based on its commitment to showing clients how to improve their return on investments made in manufacturing, management and information technology systems.</p>
        <p>“When the team wins, we all win” was the phrase Dr. D’s employees always heard when he talked about the core values of the company.  Throughout his career, Dr. Deutsch remained true to his commitment to invest in the education, training and development of people, and to promote innovative thinking and solutions for complex problems in the workplace.</p>
        <h5>Early History</h5>
        <p>Bob Deutsch was born in New York City in 1924 to a family of modest means.  Early on he combined a love of learning and sports, playing football and basketball for Far Rockaway High School where he wrote the sports column for the school paper and graduated in the top of his class.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Bob, the City University of New York (CUNY) offered qualified students an opportunity to attend tuition-free.  Bob enrolled in 1939 as an engineering major, signing up for every course in mathematics and physics offered to freshman.  He thrived academically in this challenging program.  But with the arrival of World War II, Bob left his studies to join the Army to fight for his country in Europe.</p>
        <h5>Bob and Florence</h5>
        <p>Florence Kadish came to the United States in 1939, arriving in New York City at the age of nine from Poland with her parents and brother Jack.  Starting over as Jewish refugees from war-torn Europe was a great challenge for the Kadish family.  But they soon established themselves as small merchants on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Florence and Bob first met in 1947 at Tamiment in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania where Bob was working for the summer as a waiter and Florence as a governess for a family vacationing near the resort.  Florence was a rising senior in high school.  Bob had finished his junior year at M.I.T., where he enrolled after the Army in 1944 with the help of the G.I. Bill.  Although it was not easy to leave each other at the end of the summer, Bob and Florence knew they would spend their lives together.</p>
        <p>After graduating from M.I.T., Bob accepted an invitation to enroll in the doctoral studies program in nuclear physics at Berkeley.  Florence decided to begin her college career at Hunter College in New York. After his first year of graduate studies, Bob went back to New York where he and Florence were married in the summer of 1949.  They returned to Berkeley, where Florence continued her undergraduate education while Bob completed his doctoral degree.
        <p>Bob and Florence's first child, Jane, was born in Berkeley.  Three years later, their second child, David, was born.  Completing his doctoral degree that year, Bob elected to pursue a career in the rapidly developing nuclear industry, joining the nuclear power division of General Electric in Schenectady, New York. After several corporate relocations, the family settled in Baltimore in 1964.</p>

          <h5>David Deutsch, Director</h5>
          <p>David teaches high school mathematics in Newton, Massachusetts. He received his undergraduate degree in mathematics from the University of Maryland College Park and completed graduate work in mathematics at Boston University. He began his career as a software engineer specializing in simulation software. His current focus is on curriculum development that can make mathematics more accessible to a diverse population of students.</p>
          <h5>Laurens “Mac” MacLure, Director  </h5>          
          <p>Mac is President and CEO of RWD Technologies. Previously he held a number of management positions at Pioneer EyeCare and PHH Corporation. Mac received his J.D. from the University of Maryland School of Law and his B.A. in Economics from Bucknell University.</p>

              <h4>Who We Fund</h4>
              <p>The Deutsch Foundation has been selective in the programs and institutions it has supported during its first 20 years of operation.  Its directors and staff will continue this practice, carefully researching issues significant to the public welfare, monitoring innovative trends, and selecting areas for grant making where the foundation can have significant impact, given its limited resources. We intend to concentrate our funding in Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic region.</p>
